<h3>What is going on here?</h3>
<p><strong>glomorous</strong> is a <span class='fancy'>very fancy</span> word smasher. It takes words and syllables ("glom noms") and randomly recombines them (into "gloms"). It was designed to help its creator name things because naming things is hard. Now you too will wield its awesome power.</p>
<h3>What do I do?</h3>
<p>To take <strong>glomorous</strong> for a spin, you can click the "pre-sliced" noms button along the bottom (represented by a single slice of bread). Then click the green <strong>glom!</strong> button on the upper left.</p> <p>Gloms away!</p>
<p>To use your own noms, you can type them directly into the <strong>prefixes</strong>, <strong>roots</strong>, and <strong>suffixes</strong> boxes on the right side of the screen. Roots can appear at both the start or end of words, while prefixes can only appear at the beginning and suffixes can only appear at the end.</p>
<h3>How do I save things?</h3>
<p>If you spot a glom that strikes your fancy, you can click the <i class="far fa-heart"></i> that appears next to it when your mouse pointer is nearby. This will add the glom to your <strong>faves</strong>. You can open your faves by clicking on the <i class='fas fa-heart'></i> tab at the right of the screen.</p>
<p>glom noms and faves are stored across sessions. If you close the window or your browser, they will still be there when you come back. This works for most purposes, but it's not the most reliable way to save. If you clear your browser data, for example, everything will go up in vapor.</p>
<p><strong>The most reliable way save your work is to use the copy button along the bottom.</strong> You can then paste everything into a file on your computer. glom noms are copied in a specific format, so if you paste them into a .txt file, you can reupload them later using the upload button.</p>
<h3>There are a lot of puns on this website.</h3>
<p>Correct. Puns are part of the traditional glomenclature.</p>
<h3>Does <strong>glomorous</strong> need to be open if I want to work on names?</h3>
<p>Nope! <strong>glomorous</strong> can read a .txt file. Just make sure each glom nom is on a separate line. If you want to specify that a glom nom be a prefix, add a hyphen at the end (as in "super-"). If you want to specify that it is a suffix, add a hypen to the beginning (as in "-ing").</p>
<p>Then, when you want to use your glom noms, you can upload them using the upload button at the bottom.</p>
<h3>I learned about prefixes and suffixes in elementary school and that was a long time ago.</h3>
<p>A prefix is a part of a word that is added to the beginning, like "tri-" in "triceratops" and "triangle". A suffix is added to the end, like "-ous" in "illustrious" and "glomorous".</p>
<p>All that means for <strong>glomorous</strong> is that prefixes are noms that will <i>only</i> appear at the start of a glom and suffixes are noms that <i>only</i> appear at the end of glom. Roots can appear at both the start and the end.</p>
<p>When in doubt, you can't go that wrong just adding the nom to roots. Don't worry, you can't really lose at <strong>glomorous</strong>.</p>
