<h3>Save your things.</h3>
<p>The person who designed <strong>glomorous</strong> is not <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>, the enigmatic figure behind the first blockchain database whose true identity remains shrouded in mystery. Though that would be really funny.</p>
<p>The person behind <strong>glomorous</strong> is actually an <strong>amateur programmer</strong> who often learns things by <strong>making mistakes</strong> until they eventually lead to something he thinks <strong>looks kind of pretty</strong>.</p>
<p>glom noms and faves <i>are</i> stored across sessions, but <strong>the most reliable way to save your work is to use the copy button along the bottom.</strong> You can then paste everything into a file on your computer. glom noms are copied in a specific format, so if you paste them into a .txt file, you can reupload them later using the upload button.</p>
<h3>glomorous has a foul mouth sometimes.</h3>
<p><strong>glomorous</strong> is designed to recombine whatever words you provide. That means, when you click <strong>glom!</strong>, any combination of letters in the English alphabet can materialize on the screen. This is mostly a fun and cool thing!</p>
<p><strong>However!</strong> Itâ€™s rare, but not THAT rare for glomorous to bring together a sequence of letters that humans find to be inappropriate. <strong>glomorous</strong> does not mean it and it's very sorry. It's only working with whatever glom noms are in there.</p>
<p>A filter may be in the works for a future update. For now, if you spot a glom that offends your sensibilities, you can mouse over it to see the breakdown. That will help you identify one of the two partners in crime so you can remove it from the glom noms list.</p>
<p>Proceed at your own risk! <i class="fas fa-heart"></i></p>
